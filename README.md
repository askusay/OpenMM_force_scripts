# OpenMM_force_scripts
This repository aims to document OpenMM custom forces expressions
I hope to expand this repository to include more custom forces such as soft-core potentials for LJ interactions and Morse potential for bonded interactions

### restraints.py 
OpenMM custom forces written as functions for ease of use
See notebook for exmaples
